#Project Description

This is a web application for LoyalFoods Rwanda. 
The client required a dynamic Web rather we created a simple web application because the current skills learnt and time could not allow us to work on and finish a full dynamic web.
We used REST api to create the  back-end and later used HTML to work on our user-interface where we used only screenshots to show user-interface.
We later carried out tests to ensure all our methods and functions are right and work as expected.
Because we did not have the real database to use, we used  fake Dataset.


###Project Configuration
* To create this application, we used SpringBoot application framework which made it easier.
* we kicked of with spring boot initializr.
* Most of the dependencies used to run the application come from Spring boot such as the Maven dependencies.

######Some of these spring boot dependencies are:
* Spring Web
* H2 Database
* Spring Data JPA
